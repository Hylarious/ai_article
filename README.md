# ai_article - README

## Overview

**Article AI** is a Node.js-based application that transforms plain text articles into structured HTML format. It uses OpenAI's API to generate semantic HTML within `<article>` tags, incorporating `<figure>` tags for suggested images with detailed alt text and captions. This app is perfect for quickly converting articles into a web-ready format.

## Features

- Converts text articles into well-structured HTML.
- Automatically adds placeholder `<img>` tags with detailed alt text.
- Wraps image content in `<figure>` tags with `<figcaption>` for captions.
- Saves the generated HTML to a file for easy use.
